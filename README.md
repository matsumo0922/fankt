### API Reference
[API Reference ðŸ”Ž](https://matsumo0922.github.io/fankt/)

### pixivFANBOX

To use the pixivFANBOX API, you need a session ID called `FANBOXSESSID`.  
You can obtain this session ID from the cookies after logging in via a browser.  
Refer to [PixiView-KMP](https://github.com/matsumo0922/PixiView-KMP) for details about this approach.  
Set the session ID using `fanbox.setSessionId(sessionId: String)` before using the API.

Additionally, you need to obtain a CSRF token (X-CSRF-Token) for operations like POST requests.  
You can acquire this token by calling `fanbox.updateCsrfToken()`.  
Make sure to retrieve the token before using the API.  
Since the CSRF token expires after a certain period, it is recommended to update it as needed before API calls.

```kotlin
val fanbox = Fanbox()

// Set the session ID and CSRF token before using the API
fanbox.setSessionId("your_session_id")
fanbox.updateCsrfToken()

// Example: Retrieve posts from a creator
fanbox.getCreatorPosts(creatorId = FanboxCreatorId("creator_id"))
```

### Fantia

WIP (Work in Progress)

## Samples

A [sample app](./composeApp/) with a Swagger UI-like interface is available.  
You can test API results by inputting the required parameters.
